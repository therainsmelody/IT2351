There are a lot of situations where an event scheduler would be helpful in an Ice Cream Business.  Here are just a few examples - changing promotional prices on point of sale items on a monthly basis, expiring promotional coupons, updating the expiration date of customer loyalty members, resetting customer loyalty points, and changing menu items.

The code would something like the following-

Use courtneys_icecream_shop;
-- Change statement delimiter
delimiter //
-- Creates monthly recurring event starting 10/1/2022
Create event monthly_reset_loyaltypoints
on schedule every 1 month
starts '2022-10-01'
-- Resets customer loyalty points on a monthly basis
do begin
	Update customer set loyaltypoints = '0' - interval 1 month;
END //
