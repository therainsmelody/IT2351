This stored program is intended to delete a customer from the customer table.  It uses error handling to only commit the transaction if there are no errors.  If an error is encountered it performs a rollback and informs the user that an error was encountered. It performs a database table lock while performing the deletion to prevent issues with other users selecting incorrect data while the deletion is happening.
